This is my work on the [30 Days, 30 Sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites) challenge.

**00** [Boilerplate / Template](https://github.com/VAggrippino/30Days30Sites/tree/master/00_boilerplate)
The basic code I use for starting each exercise.  

**01** Portfolio: [Spirit](01_spirit/)  
Originally intended to be a portfolio or profile page, I instead chose to make this page represent the basic spirit of my work.

**02** Event Invitation: [Food Blog](02_food_blog_template)  
Taking cues from one of the many templates made available for this exercise, I created a template for what could become a food blog.

**03** Tourist Attraction: [Colonial Williamsburg](03_colonial_williamsburg)  
Colonial Williamsburg is an actual place in Virginia, USA.

**04** Product Site: [Samsung Galaxy Note 7](07_sgnote7)  
I created a product site for the ill-fated Samsung flagship device.

I created a restaurant menu from the dishes in my actual diet.

**06** Book / Author: [J.R.R. Tolkien](06_jrr_tolkien)  
J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the greatest authors of all time. This page serves as a small tribute to him and features very brief summaries of several of his Middle-Earth books.

A movie site for Joker Rising representing the best of fan-made films.
